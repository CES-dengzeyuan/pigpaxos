## PigPaxos?

PigPaxos is a Multi-Paxos variant optimized for high number of nodes and high throughput.
PigPaxos achieves this by offloading much of the communication from the dedicated leader onto the 
follower using the Pig communication approach. Pig allows a fan-out/fan-in communication pairs
to flow through a relay node. The relay disseminates the message on the fan-out path and 
aggregates the responses on the fan-in side of the communication.
